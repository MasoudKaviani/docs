What are tradeoffs of quantization.


## Scalar Quantization


## Product Quantization


## Setting up Quantization in Qdrant

* How to enable quantization for collection
* How it is implemented: created during indexation, original vectors are stored alongside on disk or in memory, as usual
* Parameters of quantization: quantile and how it affects accuracy


### Quantization tips

* How to compare performance with and without quantization
* How to use quantization for lower memory consumption
